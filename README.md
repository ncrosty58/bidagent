# BidAgent

AI-powered property estimating engine that uses computer vision to analyze property photos, validate image appropriateness, run climate/region consistency checks, and calculate precise pricing estimates.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-Modal Computer Vision:** Classifies, validates, and analyzes exterior property images (driveway condition, building height, landscaping beds, woodwork/carpentry) to assess work complexity.
* **Smart Dynamic Estimating:** Calculates a specific, single estimated price for each line item (rather than a wide bracket range) by analyzing visual details to determine effort, scale, and condition.
* **Flexible Image Sources:** Accepts direct image file uploads (`multipart/form-data`) or comma-separated lists of public image URLs (`image_urls`) which are fetched asynchronously.
* **Climate & Region Verification:** Checks the property's style and vegetation against the provided US ZIP code's typical region (e.g. flagging tropical vegetation in Michigan to avoid fraud or incorrect listings).
* **CRM Synchronization Fallbacks:** Automatically loads price lists from Twenty CRM services and uses CRM database `basePrice` strings as fallback flat rates if they are not explicitly specified in a skill configuration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** FastAPI / Uvicorn (Python 3.12)
* **Image Processing:** Pillow
* **HTTP Client:** HTTPX (asynchronous requests)
* **LLM Engine:** OpenAI API client (supports Gemini, local models, or standard OpenAI endpoints)
* **Configuration:** Pydantic Settings & YAML

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Configuration is managed via a `.env` file located in `config/.env`:

| Variable | Description | Default / Example |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | Local container port for the web server. | `8000` |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Endpoint URL for the LLM API. | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API key to authenticate with the LLM API. | *(Your key)* |
| `LLM_MODEL_NAME` | The model name used for vision and quotes. | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `TWENTY_CRM_API_URL` | Twenty CRM server REST API base URL. | `http://bodhi.lab:3100/rest` |
| `TWENTY_CRM_BEARER_TOKEN`| Bearer token to authorize Twenty CRM requests. | *(Your CRM Token)* |
| `ACTIVE_SKILL` | The active YAML skill definition to load. | `curbclass` |

---

## 📂 Skill Configurations (`skills/`)

Pricing structures, prompts, and validation rules are configured as YAML "skills" under `/app/skills/`.

For example, `curbclass.yaml` defines:
* **`services`:** Maps Twenty CRM service names to category types, cost bracket structures (low/high limits), or flat-rates.
* **`image_rules`:** Constraints on minimum/maximum number of photos and accepted mime types.
* **`validation`:** Flags to toggle `photo_quality_check`, `content_check`, and `climate_check`.
* **`prompts`:** The custom system prompt instructing the vision estimator how to evaluate and price.
